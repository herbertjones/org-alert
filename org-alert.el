;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides functions to display system notifications for
;; any org-mode deadlines that are due in your agenda. To perform a
;; one-shot check call (org-alert-deadlines). To enable repeated
;; checking call (org-alert-enable) and to disable call
;; (org-alert-disable). You can set the checking interval by changing
;; the org-alert-interval variable to the number of seconds you'd
;; like.


;;; Code:

(require 'alert)
(require 'org-agenda)


(defvar org-alert-interval 300
  "Interval in seconds to recheck and display deadlines.")


(defvar org-alert-notification-title "*org*"
  "Title to be sent with notify-send.")

(defun org-alert--dispatch ()
  (alert (org-get-heading t t t t) :title org-alert-notification-title))

(defun org-alert-check ()
  "Check for active, due deadlines and initiate notifications."
  (interactive)
  ;; avoid interrupting current command.
  (org-map-entries 'org-alert--dispatch
                   "SCHEDULED>=\"<today>\"|DEADLINE>=\"<today>\""
                   'agenda
                   '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo org-done-keywords-for-agenda)))


(defun org-alert-enable ()
  "Enable the notification timer.  Cancels existing timer if running."
  (interactive)
  (org-alert-disable)
  (run-at-time 0 org-alert-interval 'org-alert-check))


(defun org-alert-disable ()
  "Cancel the running notification timer."
